# AI Code Detective Toolkit

A powerful toolkit for detecting, analyzing, and debugging AI-generated code. Inspired by research in AI-assisted debugging, this toolkit helps developers identify and fix common issues in AI-generated code.

## Key Features

- **AI Code Detection**: Identify code likely generated by AI tools
- **Bug Pattern Recognition**: Detect common issues in AI-generated code
- **Automated Fix Suggestions**: Get intelligent suggestions for fixing identified issues
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze code complexity and potential maintenance issues
- **Security Scanning**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-toolkit
```

## Quick Start

```python
from ai_toolkit import code_analyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = code_analyzer.AICodeAnalyzer()

# Analyze a file
results = analyzer.analyze_file('path/to/your/file.py')

# View results
print(f"AI Generated Probability: {results['ai_probability']}")
print("\nPotential Bugs:")
for bug in results['potential_bugs']:
    print(f"- {bug['description']}")
```
